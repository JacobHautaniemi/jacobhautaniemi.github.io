### Professional Summary
<p>
I am currently in my third year of studying a Bachelor of Mathematics and Science (Physics) at Queensland University of Technology. If you were to ask my friends about me, Iâ€™d be described as an academically rigorous, devoted, and high aspiring student familiar with mathematics, technology, and customer interaction. My extroverted heart and mind also help me to connect with almost anyone in the room.
<br><br>
In my introductory and now upper-level coursework, I've developed a keen interest in medical mathematics and am extremely interested in pursuing research as both an undergraduate and postgraduate. To achieve this, I value the knowledge my seniors and industry and academic professionals can provide me, particularly with networking which is truly invaluable. </p>

<p>Within my undergraduate classwork I have taken a keen interest to the operation of MRI. As an aspiring mathematician and physcist, I am able to pursue this from two disjoint yet complimentary perspectives. Truly, it is quantum physics that provides the theoretical framework for operation, but mathematics that allows for the extraction of this data in meaningful ways.  </p>

<br>
<p> Over the summer of 2019/2020 I was fortunate enough to research the migration patterns of chemotherapy to better understand this process on a mathematical scale. Within this project I also simulated mechanisms to bias its migration, which is important as chemotherapy currently kills both malignant and healthy cells. </p>
